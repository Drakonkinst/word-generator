# Word Generator
A simple word generator for Java. It can be used to make words for a constructed language, to get an original nickname, or even generate your own hard-to-guess yet rememberable passwords. Word construction can be defined by assigning subpatterns and a main pattern, where the content assigned to the subpattern will replace its shortcut letter in the main pattern.
